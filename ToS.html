        <h3> A. Local Storage:</h3>

        <p>
            Currently, the services we provide are available online on the internet.
            Within this website, certain actions may be recorded by our local
            storage instead of the more appealing SQL satabase to help keep track
            of your records. These records,  again, will not be distributed or made public
            for anyone to see. These records will entirely be within the user's reach.
            Not even the developers may access these records. These local storages were
            made to enhance your experience.
        </p>

            with the commuinty by playing single player games like rock paper scissors.
            In order to keep our mission a success, we are going to require you to answer
            the forms we have provided. Your answers
            will be directly sent to the developers' gmail accounts and will not be shared
            with anyone except the developers or someone with authority to change the developers'
            grades.
        </p>
